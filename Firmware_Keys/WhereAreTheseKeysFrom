Hi Ludwig

I am reverse engineering a Bosch RCC A2 Headunit that maches the one in my vehicle. 
I am currently looking at the USB firmware update process and stumbled accross your github site.

I am wondering where did you get access to these firmware keys that can decrypt NAC devices? 


I am currently looking for similar keys for RCC.
I tried the chinese RCC updates you have but once unpacked they look more like the Continental NAC units firmware updates. 

These are the files available for update for my ebay headunit
